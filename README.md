# Light Refraction - Interactive Lab 🧪✨

A modern, browser-based physics simulation of light refraction and total internal reflection. Designed to demonstrate Snell's Law intuitively and visually.

## 🌟 Features

*   **Realistic Ray Tracing:** The path of the light beam is calculated precisely according to Snell's Law ($n_1 \sin \theta_1 = n_2 \sin \theta_2$).
*   **Interactive Interface:**
    *   Drag the light source with a mouse or touch.
    *   Adjust refractive indices with sliders.
    *   Switch light direction (up/down) with a button press.
*   **Total Internal Reflection (TIR):** Visual alert and behavior change when the critical angle is exceeded.
*   **Tools:**
    *   Built-in protractor for measuring angles.
    *   Data panel showing precise values in real-time.
*   **Responsive:** Works smoothly on both desktop and mobile devices.
*   **Modern Design:** Professional "Clean Lab" style.

## 🚀 Getting Started

This project is implemented as a single standalone HTML file (`index.html`), so it requires no installation or server.

1.  Download the repository or the `index.html` file.
2.  Open `index.html` in any modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).

## 🛠️ Technologies

*   **HTML5 Canvas:** High-performance 2D graphics and animations.
*   **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+):** Object-Oriented (OOP) structure with no external libraries.
*   **CSS3:** Modern layout with Flexbox and full responsiveness.

## 📚 Physics

The simulation is based on Snell's Law:

$$
\frac{\sin \alpha_1}{\sin \alpha_2} = \frac{n_2}{n_1}
$$

Where:
*   $n_1, n_2$ = Refractive indices of the media
*   $\alpha_1$ = Angle of incidence
*   $\alpha_2$ = Angle of refraction
